# RNN Poem Generation
A Recurrent Neural Network capable of infinitely generating poetry. The Keras RNN is trained using the _poem.txt_ file. If you wish to train another model, please set _retrain=True_ or change _output\_model\_path_ to another path of your choosing.

To use the RNN, this can be done by either using _PoemGeneration.py_ after training a model, or using _GradioApp.py_ for gradio deployment.
